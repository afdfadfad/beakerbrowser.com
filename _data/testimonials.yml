  text: "Huge congrats to the Beaker guys @pfrazee @mafintosh who've worked on this deep technical challenge for years.
\n
\nPEER TO PEER HYPERTEXT
\n
\nThat means no ads, no posting on a giant tech company's site, no censorship. Everyone is master of their own domain."

  text: "This is brilliant! @BeakerBrowser is pushing the limit of what a web browser can be. What if you could pull up a Terminal on any website and look at how it is built?
\n
\nBeaker is one of the most interesting web products around, and definitely my favorite decentralized web product!"

  text: "Let me say a bit about why I'm endorsing @BeakerBrowser as the \"future publishing platform of choice.\"
\n
\nIt's not a blockchain protocol, it's just a way of serving your stuff off your laptop - or that of your friends. But it works with existing web-developer skills: will grow fast"

  text: "Open source software and github made it really easy to learn, remix and create web projects. What if you could fork a site/app and edit it?
\n
\n@BeakerBrowser is creating this for the decentralized web. I love the concepts around beaker, hoping to see some adoption!"

\n- Finally a browser that has contacts!
\n- New hyperdrive APIs addresses all the shortcomings of older DatArchive API
\n- Tells you about your network connectivity"

  text: "anyone free to help me figure out how to implement a social network on @BeakerBrowser? I have a good chunk of it written with a traditional centralized serverless model but this is obviously the future and I want to migrate it right now."
